      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m Back! After a ton of turmoil and pain, I am finally back, and I am able to write and make articles again.
Where Did I Go? I went through basic training. It was tough, and it took a lot out of me. Now, I am finally able to update my website again.
Moving forward, this website will be about more than just tech. I will be doing reviews and such on more products, especially considering how I am now in the military.</description>

      <description>Linux Mint Background
Note: This is not endoursed by the Debian or Linux Mint Debian Edition team. Continue with this guide at your own risk.
Today, I decided to try and take a bare Debian 11 installation and turn it into an LMDE 5 install. How hard could it be?
Why would you do this? I already use LMDE 5 on my laptop. The only thing I don&amp;rsquo;t like about it is how many packages are pre-installed (over 2000!</description>

Hey guys, it has been a long time since I last posted on this blog. There are many reasons for that, but I will not get into them. I recently tried out Ubuntu Touch on my Google Pixel 3a XL, and I thought I would give it a review.
At the time of writing, I was testing this out on OTA-22 with installer version 0.9.5. Some of my complaints may have been fixed in a newer update.</description>

      <description>Fedora Logo
I decided to try Fedora 34 on my Surface Pro 2, and here is my experience.
Installation Installation of Fedora was pretty easy. I just selected my disk, changed my timezone, and off it went. The Anaconda installer is really good, but I still think that certain installers are better. Everything went well, and it installed properly.
Using Fedora Using Fedora on my Surface Pro 2 was pretty cool.</description>

I used the Ubuntu Unity desktop for a few days. Here are my thoughts about the Unity desktop in 2021.
The Good I love the Unity desktop. I used it back in 2014 and 2016 when I would try out Ubuntu from time to time. I never really dove into the power user features of it, but I liked the desktop. Around a few days ago, I decided to try it out again using Ubuntu 20.</description>

After reinstalling Debian 10 on my Macbook 4,1, I realized that I made a few mistakes in my guide. This post is a tutorial on how to properly install Debian 10 on a Macbook 4,1.
Installation When you go through the installation process, choose graphical install. You need to have a secondary mouse, as the trackpad won&amp;rsquo;t work during the install, and it won&amp;rsquo;t work very well after the install.</description>

      <description>Airpods (Photo by PCMag)
Hello guys! I have been trying out the Airpods 1st generation for around a week now, and I have a few things to say. Let&amp;rsquo;s get right into it!
The Good The Airpods are really nice. The integration with my iPhone 7 is great because I get to use the battery widget. I also like the popup that appears that tells me the case battery percentage and the Airpods themselves.</description>

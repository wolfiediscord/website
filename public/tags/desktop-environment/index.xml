      <description>Ubuntu Logo
I used the Ubuntu Unity desktop for a few days. Here are my thoughts about the Unity desktop in 2021.
The Good I love the Unity desktop. I used it back in 2014 and 2016 when I would try out Ubuntu from time to time. I never really dove into the power user features of it, but I liked the desktop. Around a few days ago, I decided to try it out again using Ubuntu 20.</description>

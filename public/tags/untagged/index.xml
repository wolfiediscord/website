      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m Back! After a ton of turmoil and pain, I am finally back, and I am able to write and make articles again.
Where Did I Go? I went through basic training. It was tough, and it took a lot out of me. Now, I am finally able to update my website again.
Moving forward, this website will be about more than just tech. I will be doing reviews and such on more products, especially considering how I am now in the military.</description>

      <description>Since I now have this new website where I can blog, I will gradually transition my current blog to this website. If you didn&amp;rsquo;t already know, my blog is wolfiestech.blogspot.com. I will be uploading posts from that blog to here.
UPDATE: I have finished uploading the posts from my old blog to here. Now, you don&amp;rsquo;t need to visit that site again.</description>

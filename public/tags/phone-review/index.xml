The experience was pretty good, as I will write later in this post. I managed to get Android 10 to run on it using a custom ROM called Resurrection Remix.

Last night, I decided to try out the HTC First, (also known as the Facebook phone), in 2020. It runs Android 4.1.2. I got the idea from watching a Luke Smith video about how he did not use a phone at all apart from when he goes out to shoot in the forest.
I installed some apps on there, such as TickTick, a Flashlight app (Android didn&amp;rsquo;t have a flashlight toggle yet!</description>

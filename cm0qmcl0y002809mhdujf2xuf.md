*My HTC First's Homescreen*

Last night, I decided to try out the HTC First, (also known as the Facebook phone), in 2020. It runs Android 4.1.2. I got the idea from watching a Luke Smith video about how he did not use a phone at all apart from when he goes out to shoot in the forest.

I installed some apps on there, such as TickTick, a Flashlight app (Android didn't have a flashlight toggle yet!), and AccuWeather (since MyRadar was not compatible). I already had a few apps on the device from playing around with it a year or two ago, such as Twilight (a blue light filter), Nova Launcher, and a few others. I decided to remove Nova Launcher, as I wanted the stock android experience. Also, I had turned off the Facebook Launcher a year or two ago because it was broken.

To my surprise, it was basically stock android apart from the Facebook logo when you start up the device. There were a few bloat apps, but I disabled those when playing around with it that one time. Other than that, it barely had any apps that I would consider bloat. I also updated it the night before using it, so it ran the latest Google apps and the latest Messenger app.

Sadly, most apps were not compatible, but that isn't surprising when you are trying to run a OS made in 2012 in the year 2020. Although, for basic tasks such as texting, calling, viewing the calendar, light web browsing, and using TickTick, it was fine.

The device doesn't have what I would call flagship specs, which is probably one of the reasons why the HTC First flopped in the market. It comes with 1GB of RAM, 16GB of internal storage with no microSD expansion, a 5MP camera and a 1.6MP selfie camera. It also came in a variety of colors. Mine is the red color, but it has a stain from a monster sticker that had been on the phone for too long.

Overall, this phone was pretty nice to use in 2020. It was nice to see what I had missed out on in 2012 with stock android. I am definitely going to switch back to my iPhone 7, but this phone helped me realize what I really needed from a smartphone. Sure, I like listening to music with my earbuds, using discord on the go without a laptop, watching YouTube at lunch, texting friends with iMessage, but it isn't necessary on a smartphone. This phone helped me learn a valuable life lesson, and that is to appreciate what you have, as others may not be so lucky.

Hello guys! I have been trying out the Airpods 1st generation for around a week now, and I have a few things to say. Let's get right into it!

## The Good

The Airpods are really nice. The integration with my iPhone 7 is great because I get to use the battery widget. I also like the popup that appears that tells me the case battery percentage and the Airpods themselves. I also like how the double tap is changeable, as I don't really use Siri or ever go back to a previous track with my regular earbuds.

I also like some of the other features of Airpods, such as the ear detection. I love being able to just take out one Airpod, and it pauses my music. I don't get why other wireless earbud manufactures haven't thought of this already. It's also nice that it pauses my music when I put the Airpods in the case.

## The Bad

The Airpods were kind of a disappointment to me. I thought they were going to be super good, especially considering how they were $160 USD before the 2nd generation came out. However, they are not as good as I thought. Since the Airpods don't have any sealing, noise leaks into my ears constantly. I have to adjust the volume to the point where I get a headache if I want to hear my music on the bus. My other earbuds, the Skullcandy Sesh Evos have the tip, which seals my ears and makes the listening experience much better.

I also don't like the fact that the Airpods only support double tapping. This might change in the future with a firmware update, but I think that is unlikely as the Airpods 2nd generation have support for more than just double tapping. I feel like Apple could have done better. It gets really annoying having to change the volume with my phone's buttons instead of just using the taps on my Airpods. That is a feature I had on my Skullcandy earbuds for a long time.

## Conclusion

If you are looking to pick up a pair of Airpods, consider other options. If you are heavily invested in the Apple ecosystem, go for it. However, if you are not heavily invested, try looking for other options.

If you want good wireless earbuds for a third of the price of Airpods, the Skullcandy Sesh Evos are the earbuds to get. They do have some annoyances, such as not having touch controls, but they have many more features than the Airpods. They also charge using USB Type-C, so if you have an Android phone made in the past few years, your phone charger will work with them.

Overall, if you are heavily invested in the Apple ecosystem and you don't want to spend more money on the Airpods Pro, go for the Airpods; however, the Airpods Pro are probably much better than the regular Airpods, as they have the sealing that regular Airpods lack. If you are not heavily invested in the Apple ecosystem, go for the Skullcandy Sesh Evos or explore other options. Thank you for reading my article.

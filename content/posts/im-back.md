## I'm Back!
After a ton of turmoil and pain, I am finally back, and I am able to write and make articles again. 

## Where Did I Go?
I went through basic training. It was tough, and it took a lot out of me. Now, I am finally able to update my website again. 

Moving forward, this website will be about more than just tech. I will be doing reviews and such on more products, especially considering how I am now in the military.
